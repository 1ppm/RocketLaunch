# The Launch Countdown

If you created a **great product** and you are planning to lauch it, let the 1PPM community know! Some members may be on that platform, decide to upvote or promote the launch on twitter!

*Disclaimer: I'm not telling anybody what to do with that information ;)*



That said:
* Community: please have a look at the projects before the launch. The product should be well designed. It does not need a lot of features, but the exsiting ones should work perfectly (contact the author if you find bugs!).
* No submissions of already launched, running products!

## How to Use the Launch Countdown

Add your projects to [LaunchCountdown.md](LaunchCountdown.md), at the bottom of the table, on time, via pull request. The earlier you set a date, the less space for procrastination ;)

 To make sure that the specified quality criteria is met, there will be a review process. Questions can be discussed on Slack.

The data in the table should be parseable, so that the (future) 1PPM-Bot can announce your project launch on **twitter** and **Slack** on time.

Please provide the launch time in the format: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm [UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/aboututc.html)
The description should be short and match the information on the platform.

The feedback channel should allow the community to provide feedback and report bugs to the author.

Example:

|Time   |Project                                                |Description             |Platform| Twitter | Feedback Channel | Campaign Link |
