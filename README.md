# [1PPM](http://1ppm.club) Rocket Launch

The 1PPM [Hall of Fame](HallOfFame.md) contains many learning- and personal projects. That is perfectly fine. Publicly announcing your goals will help you to actually achieve them and you will be in good company! However, some developers may discover on their way, that an idea would profit from a bigger audience and decide to launch on [Producthunt](https://www.producthunt.com/), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/), [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/)...(add platforms here).

Therefore 1PPM set up the **1PPM Rocket Launch** program to support these launches in any way possible.

The first two features of the 1PPM rocket launch program are the [Rocket Launch Resource Database](/resources) and the Rocket Launch Countdown.

# The Launch Countdown

If you created a **great product** and you are planning to lauch it, let the 1PPM community know! Some members may be on that platform, decide to upvote or promote the launch on twitter!

*Disclaimer: I'm not telling anybody what to do with that information ;)*



That said:
* Community: please have a look at the projects before the launch. The product should be well designed. It does not need a lot of features, but the exsiting ones should work perfectly (contact the author if you find bugs!).
* No submissions of already launched, running products!

## How to Use the Launch Countdown

Add your projects to "LaunchCountdown.md", at the bottom of the table, on time, via pull request. The earlier you set a date, the less space for procrastination ;)

 To make sure that the specified quality criteria is met, there will be a review process. Questions can be discussed on Slack.

The data in the table should be parseable, so that the (future) 1PPM-Bot can announce your project launch on **twitter** and **Slack** on time.

Please provide the launch time in the format: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm [UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/aboututc.html)
The description should be short and match the information on the platform.

The feedback channel should allow the community to provide feedback and report bugs to the author.

Example:

|Time   |Project                                                |Description             |Platform| Twitter | Feedback Channel | Campaign Link |

## In return...

It is encouraged that the launching projects share their learnings with the community afterwards via the Rocket Launch [resources database](/resources). Experiences, traffic, conversion rates, sales funnel, lessons learned and in general any information that could be helpful. Examples can be found in the resources section.

## Just one more thing...
If any 1PPM challengers are looking for ideas for learning/OSS projects, have a look at the Rocket Launch [issue tracker](/issues) for related projects.
